# Binary To Array Of Byte

Generate an array of bytes and stores it in an easy to use header file from a binary file on disk.

## Why?

Maybe you don't want to ship your .exe with additional files or want to load the file from memory for obscurity.

## Usage

Drag and drop your binary onto BinaryToAOB.exe and the generated header file will be placed in the same folder as the binary.

Introduction
------------

Binary-To-AOB is a console application designed to simplify the process of embedding files into your C++ projects. It eliminates the need to deal with Windows resources, offering a more portable solution across platforms. The application achieves this by converting an entire file into an array of bytes (AOB) and generating a header file that can be easily integrated into your application.

Features
--------

1.  Drag-and-Drop Functionality: Binary-To-AOB is designed with simplicity in mind. To convert a binary file to an array of bytes, all you need to do is drag and drop the file onto the application.

2.  Automatic Header File Generation: Upon conversion, the application automatically generates a header file with the same name as the binary file. This header file contains the array of bytes representing the binary file, making it ready for use in your C++ projects.

3.  Cross-Platform Portability: Unlike dealing with Windows resources, the array of bytes generated by Binary-To-AOB can be used across different platforms, increasing the portability of your C++ projects.

How It Works
------------

Binary-To-AOB operates by opening a file stream with the flag `std::ios::binary`, iterating over all of the bytes in the file, and writing them to a file along with some C syntax formatting. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1.  File Stream Creation: The application creates an input file stream using the binary file you provide. It opens the file in binary mode and positions the file pointer at the end (`std::ios::binary | std::ios::ate`).

2.  Array of Bytes (AOB) Creation: It then determines the size of the file and creates an array of bytes (`aob`) of the same size to store the file bytes.

3.  File Reading: The application moves the file pointer back to the beginning of the file and reads the entire file into the `aob`. After reading, it closes the binary file.

4.  Header File Creation: Binary-To-AOB creates a header file with the same filename as the binary file. It opens a file stream for this header file.

5.  Writing to Header File: The application writes the contents of the `aob` to the header file in a specific format. Each byte is written as a hexadecimal value, followed by a comma. After writing all the bytes, it closes the header file and deletes the `aob`.

6.  Completion Message: Finally, the application prints a message indicating that the AOB header file has been created.

User Experience Level
---------------------

Binary-To-AOB is designed to be user-friendly and does not require extensive programming knowledge to use. However, to fully understand and modify the source code, a basic understanding of C++ and file I/O operations is recommended.

End Goal
--------

The primary goal of Binary-To-AOB is to simplify the process of embedding binary files into C++ projects. It does this by converting binary files into an array of bytes (AOB) and generating a header file that can be easily included in your C++ code. This approach bypasses the need to deal with Windows resources, making your code more portable across different platforms.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
--------------------------------

Q1: What is an Array of Bytes (AOB)?

An Array of Bytes (AOB) is essentially a sequence of bytes, where each byte is usually represented as a hexadecimal value. In the context of Binary-To-AOB, an AOB is a representation of a binary file that can be easily embedded into a C++ project.

Q2: How do I use the generated header file in my C++ project?

The generated header file contains an array named `binary[]` that holds the byte representation of your binary file. To use it in your C++ project, simply include the header file using the `#include` directive. You can then access the `binary[]` array in your code.

Q3: Can I use Binary-To-AOB with non-binary files?

Yes, Binary-To-AOB can be used with any file type. The application treats all files as binary data and converts them into an array of bytes.

Q4: Why am I seeing a message saying "You must drag and drop your binary onto this .exe"?

This message appears when you run the application without providing a binary file. To use Binary-To-AOB, you need to drag and drop your binary file onto the application.

Glossary of Terms
-----------------

1.  Binary File: A binary file is a file that contains binary data -- that is, data that is stored in binary format. This data can represent various types of information, including text, images, audio, and executable code.

2.  Array of Bytes (AOB): An AOB is a sequence of bytes, where each byte is usually represented as a hexadecimal value. In the context of Binary-To-AOB, an AOB is a representation of a binary file that can be easily embedded into a C++ project.

3.  Header File: In C and C++, a header file is a file with a `.h` extension that contains C function declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several source files.

4.  File Stream: In C++, a file stream is an object of one of the file stream classes (`ifstream`, `ofstream`, `fstream`) used to read from and write to files.

5.  Hexadecimal Value: Hexadecimal is a base-16 number system. It uses sixteen distinct symbols, most often the symbols "0"--"9" to represent values zero to nine, and "A"--"F" to represent values ten to fifteen.

6.  Windows Resources: In the context of programming, Windows resources are data embedded in the executable file of a Windows application. These can include icons, cursors, strings, etc.
